/**
 * This interface represents an abstract challenge-response oriented authentication scheme.
 * <p>
 * Authentication schemes can be either request or connection based. The former are
 * expected to provide an authorization response with each request message while the latter
 * is executed only once and applies to the underlying connection for its entire life span.
 * Care must be taken when re-using connections authorized through a connection based
 * authentication scheme and they may carry a particular security context and be authorized
 * for a particular user identity. It is important that such schemes always provide
 * the user identity they represent through the {@link #getPrincipal()} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Authentication scheme are expected to transition through a series of standard phases or
 * states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Authentication scheme starts off its life cycle with no context and no specific state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #processChallenge(AuthChallenge, HttpContext)} method is called  to
 * process an authentication challenge received either from the target server or a proxy.
 * The authentication scheme transitions to CHALLENGED state and is expected to validate
 * the token passed to it as a parameter and initialize its internal state based on
 * challenge details. Standard authentication schemes are expected to provide a realm
 * attribute in the challenge. {@link #getRealm()} can be called to obtain an identifier
 * of the realm that requires authorization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once the challenge has been fully processed the {@link #isResponseReady(HttpHost,
 * CredentialsProvider, HttpContext)} method to determine whether the scheme is capable of
 * generating a authorization response based on its current state and it holds user credentials
 * required to do so. If this method returns {@code false} the authentication is considered
 * to be in FAILED state and no authorization response. Otherwise the scheme is considered
 * to be in RESPONSE_READY state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once the scheme is ready to respond to the challenge the {@link #generateAuthResponse(
 * HttpHost, HttpRequest, HttpContext)} method to generate a response token, which will
 * be sent to the opposite endpoint in the subsequent request message.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Certain non-standard schemes may involve multiple challenge / response exchanges to
 * fully establish a shared context and complete the authentication process. Authentication
 * schemes are required to return {@code true} {@link #isChallengeComplete()} once the
 * handshake is considered complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The authentication scheme is considered successfully completed and in SUCCESS state
 * if the opposite endpoint accepts the request message containing the authorization
 * response and responds with a message indicating no authentication failure .
 * If the opposite endpoint sends status code 401 or 407 in response to a request message
 * containing the terminal authorization response, the scheme is considered unsuccessful
 * and in FAILED state.
 * </p>

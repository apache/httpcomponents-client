/**
 * <p>The {@code AIMDBackoffManager} applies an additive increase,
 * multiplicative decrease (AIMD) to managing a dynamic limit to
 * the number of connections allowed to a given host. You may want
 * to experiment with the settings for the cooldown periods and the
 * backoff factor to get the adaptive behavior you want.</p>
 *
 * <p>Generally speaking, shorter cooldowns will lead to more steady-state
 * variability but faster reaction times, while longer cooldowns
 * will lead to more stable equilibrium behavior but slower reaction
 * times.</p>
 *
 * <p>Similarly, higher backoff factors promote greater
 * utilization of available capacity at the expense of fairness
 * among clients. Lower backoff factors allow equal distribution of
 * capacity among clients (fairness) to happen faster, at the
 * expense of having more server capacity unused in the short term.</p>

/**
 * Callback interface for receiving Server-Sent Events (SSE) and lifecycle
 * notifications from an {@link EventSource}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should keep handlers lightweight and non-blocking.
 * If you need to do heavy work, offload to your own executor.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Invocation & threading</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Methods may be invoked on an internal callback executor supplied to the
 *       {@code EventSource} (or on the caller thread if none was supplied).
 *       Do not assume a specific thread.</li>
 *   <li>Handlers may be invoked concurrently; make your listener thread-safe.</li>
 *   <li>Exceptions thrown by handlers are caught and logged by the caller; they
 *       do not stop the stream.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Event semantics</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #onOpen()} is called once the HTTP response is accepted and the
 *       SSE stream is ready.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onEvent(String, String, String)} is called for each SSE event.
 *       The {@code type} defaults to {@code "message"} when {@code null}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onFailure(Throwable, boolean)} is called when the stream fails.
 *       If {@code willReconnect} is {@code true}, a reconnect attempt has been scheduled.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onClosed()} is called exactly once when the stream is permanently
 *       closed (either by {@link EventSource#cancel()} or after giving up on reconnects).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since 5.6

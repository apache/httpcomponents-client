/**
 * Represents a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection to a remote resource.

 * starting, cancelling, header management, and basic state and offset (Last-Event-ID).
 * Implementations are provided by this module (for example, via
 * a factory such as {@code SseExecutor#open(...)}), which wires the
 * {@link EventSourceListener} that receives events.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Thread-safety</h3>
 * <p>Implementations should be safe for concurrent use: {@link #start()} and
 * {@link #cancel()} are expected to be idempotent, and header methods should be
 * safe to call at any time prior to (re)connect.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Last-Event-ID</h3>
 * <p>{@code Last-Event-ID} follows the SSE spec: the most recent non-null event
 * id is remembered by the implementation and can be sent on subsequent reconnects
 * so the server can resume the stream.</p>

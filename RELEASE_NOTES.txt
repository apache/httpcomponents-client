Release 4.1.3
-------------------

The HttpClient 4.1.3 is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues found since 4.1.2 
primarily in the HTTP caching module. 

All users of HttpClient are encouraged to upgrade.

* [HTTPCLIENT-1153] MemcachedHttpCacheStorage uses URL as cache key but
  shouldn't; may exceed max memcached key length. Note that this bugfix
  restores correct behavior by simply not caching these urls. A more
  thorough fix to actually cache these will be available in version 4.2. 
  Contributed by Jon Moore <jonm at apache dot org>.
  
* [HTTPCLIENT-1157] MemcachedHttpCacheStorage should throw IOExceptions
  instead of RuntimeExceptions.
  Contributed by James Miller <jamesmiller01 at gmail dot com>.
  
* [HTTPCLIENT-1152] MemcachedHttpCacheStorage should verify class of
  returned object before casting.
  Contributed by Rajika Kumarasiri <rajika at wso2 dot com>.

* [HTTPCLIENT-1155] CachingHttpClient fails to ensure that the response content gets fully consumed 
  when using a ResponseHandler, which can potentially lead to connection leaks.
  Contributed by James Miller <jamesmiller01 at gmail dot com>
  
* [HTTPCLIENT-1147] When HttpClient-Cache cannot open cache file, should act like miss.
  Contributed by Joe Campbell <joseph.r.campbell at gmail.com>

* [HTTPCLIENT-1140] Infinite loop in case of an authentication failure if WARN priority logging 
  is disabled. 

* [HTTPCLIENT-1127] Fixed deadlock between SingleClientConnManager.releaseConnection() and
  SingleClientConnManager.shutdown()
  
* [HTTPCLIENT-1143] CachingHttpClient leaks connections with stale-if-error.
  Contributed by James Miller <jamesmiller01 at gmail dot com>


Release 4.1.2
-------------------

release 4.1, including one critical security issue (HTTPCLIENT-1061). All users of HttpClient 4.0.x
and 4.1 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

* [HTTPCLIENT-1069] HttpHostConnectException not correctly retried for direct and non-tunnelled
  proxy connections.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-1066] Changed the way URIUtils#rewriteURI handles multiple consecutive slashes in the

Release 4.1
-------------------

The HttpClient 4.1 release builds upon the stable foundation laid by HttpClient 4.0 and adds several
functional improvements and popular features.

* Response caching conditionally compliant with HTTP/1.1 specification (full compliance with
  MUST requirements, partial compliance with SHOULD requirements)

* Full support for NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and NTLM2 Session authentication. The NTLM protocol code
  was kindly contributed by the Lucene Connector Framework project.

* Support for SPNEGO/Kerberos authentication.

* Persistence of authentication data between request executions within the same execution context.

* Support for preemptive authentication for BASIC and DIGEST schemes.

* Support for transparent content encoding. Please note transparent content encoding is not
  enabled per default in order to avoid conflicts with already existing custom content encoding
  solutions.

* Mechanism to bypass the standard certificate trust verification (useful when dealing with
  self-signed certificates).

* Simplified configuration for connection managers.

* Transparent support for host multihoming.

IMPORTANT: please note that the HttpClient 3.x branch is now officially END OF LIFE and is no longer
maintained and supported by the Apache HttpComponents project.

Changelog
-------------------
* The public API for the caching module had a minor change between 4.1-beta and 4.1-GA to the
  HttpCacheEntry class - the deprecated public Set<String> getVariantURIs() method and constructor
  public HttpCacheEntry(Date requestDate, Date responseDate,
            StatusLine statusLine, Header[] responseHeaders,
            Resource resource, Set<String> variants)
  were both removed.  This will not affect you unless you are implementing new storage backends
  that use the deprecated code and/or are implementing custom serializers for cache entries.

* Changed Browser-Compatibility and Best-Match cookie policies to emulate the behaviour of FireFox
  more closely when parsing Netscape style cookies. Comma will no longer be treated as a header
  element separator if Set-Cookie does not contain a Version attribute mandated by the
  RFC2109 / RFC 2965 cookie specifications.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-1036] StringBody has incorrect default for characterset. (Default changed
  to US-ASCII)

  Michajlo Matijkiw <michajlo_matijkiw at comcast.com>, and
  Matthew Hawthorne <matthew_hawthorne at comcast.com>.

* [HTTPCLIENT-1033] HttpRoute.equals(Object o) is quite inefficient, as it does not take full
  advantage of shortcut logic.
  Contributed by Sebastian Bazley <sebb at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-1030] Implement "ignoreCookies" CookieSpec
  Contributed by Sebastian Bazley <sebb at apache.org>

Release 4.1 ALPHA2
-------------------

HttpClient 4.1 ALPHA2 fixes a number of non-severe bugs discovered since
the last release and introduces support for two frequently requested features:

* HTTP/1.1 response caching

* transparent support for host multihoming

Compatibility notes
-------------------
(1) Please note the HTTP caching module is still considered experimental and
its API may change significantly in the future releases.

(2) This release eliminates Mime4J as a dependency for the HttpMime module.
HttpMime is no longer binary compatible with the previous releases.
Full API and binary compatibility between minor versions of HttpMime will be
maintained as of 4.1 GA release.

Release 4.0
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.


Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known major
  architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline.

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API.

* More modular structure.

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more efficient HTTP
  transport based on HttpCore.

* Implementation of cross-cutting HTTP protocol aspects through protocol
  interceptors.

* Improved connection management, better handling of persistent connections,
  support for stateful connections

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers.

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of proxies

* More flexible SSL context customization

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of generating HTTP requests
  and parsing HTTP responses


Important notes
-------------------

* Future releases of HttpMime module may be binary incompatible with this
  release due to possible API changes in Apache Mime4J. Apache Mime4J is
  still being actively developed and its API is considered unstable.

* HttpClient 4.0 is not fully binary compatible with 4.0 BETA1 release.
  Some protected variables in connection management class have been
  made final in order to help ensure their thread safety:

improvements in the area of connection management. Among the most notable
ones is the capability to handle stateful connections such as persistent
NTLM connections and private key authenticated SSL connections.

This is the first API stable release of HttpClient 4.0. All further
releases in the 4.0 code line will maintain API compatibility with this
release.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA4. All upstream
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

Please note HttpClient currently provides only limited support for NTLM
authentication. For details please see NTLM_SUPPORT.txt.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 4
-------------------

ALPHA4 marks the completion of the overhaul of the connection management
code in HttpClient. All known shortcomings of the old HttpClient 3.x
connection management API have been addressed.

NTLM authentication remains the only missing major feature in the new
codeline that prevents us from moving awards the API freeze.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA3. All upstream
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported:
-------------------

* NTLM authentication scheme

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 3
-------------------

ALPHA3 release brings another round of API refinements and improvements in
functionality. As of this release HttpClient requires Java 5 compatible
runtime environment and takes full advantage of generics and new concurrency
primitives.

This release also introduces new default cookie policy that selects a cookie
specification depending on the format of cookies sent by the target host.
It is no longer necessary to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support
the target host provides. HttpClient is now able to pick up either a lenient
or a strict cookie policy depending on the compliance level of the target host.

Another notable improvement is a completely reworked support for multipart
entities based on Apache mime4j library.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.

The HttpClient 4.0 API is still very experimental and is bound to change
during the course of the ALPHA development phase. Several important features
have not yet been ported to the new API.

Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known
  major architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more
  efficient HTTP transport based on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is
  expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

* More modular structure

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers

* Support for protocol incerceptors

* Improved connection management

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of
  proxies

* Improved handling redirects of entity enclosing requests

* More flexible SSL context customization

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of
  generating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP responses

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported
-------------------
* NTLM authentication scheme

* RFC2965 cookie policy (Cookie2)

* Support for multipart MIME coded entities

-------------------

Changelog

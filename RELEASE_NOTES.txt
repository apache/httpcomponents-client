Release 4.0.1
-------------------

This is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues discovered since 
the previous stable release. None of the fixed bugs is considered critical. 
Most notably this release eliminates eliminates dependency on JCIP annotations.

This release is also expected to improve performance by 5 to 10% due to
elimination of unnecessary Log object lookups by short-lived components.

Changelog
-------------------

* [HTTPCLIENT-895] Eliminated Log object lookups by short-lived components 
  impairing performance.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-885] URLEncodedUtils now correctly parses form-url-encoded 
  entities that specify a charset.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

  header.

  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

  authentication results in a redirect. This is a minor bug as HttpClient 
  manages to recover from the problem automatically.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

  it possible for an aborted connection to be returned to the pool.

Release 4.0
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.


Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known major 
  architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline.

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API.

* More modular structure.

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more efficient HTTP 
  transport based on HttpCore. 

* Implementation of cross-cutting HTTP protocol aspects through protocol 
  interceptors.

* Improved connection management, better handling of persistent connections,
  support for stateful connections

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers.   

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of proxies 

* More flexible SSL context customization 

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of generating HTTP requests 
  and parsing HTTP responses 


Important notes
-------------------

* Future releases of HttpMime module may be binary incompatible with this 
  release due to possible API changes in Apache Mime4J. Apache Mime4J is
  still being actively developed and its API is considered unstable.
  
* HttpClient 4.0 is not fully binary compatible with 4.0 BETA1 release.
  Some protected variables in connection management class have been
  made final in order to help ensure their thread safety:

Release 4.0 beta 2
-------------------

discovered since the previous release.

bundle combining HttpClient and HttpMime jars.

  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>


4.0 Beta 1
-------------------

BETA1 release brings yet another round of API enhancements and 
improvements in the area of connection management. Among the most notable
ones is the capability to handle stateful connections such as persistent 
NTLM connections and private key authenticated SSL connections.

This is the first API stable release of HttpClient 4.0. All further 
releases in the 4.0 code line will maintain API compatibility with this
release.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA4. All upstream 
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

Please note HttpClient currently provides only limited support for NTLM
authentication. For details please see NTLM_SUPPORT.txt.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 4
-------------------

ALPHA4 marks the completion of the overhaul of the connection management 
code in HttpClient. All known shortcomings of the old HttpClient 3.x 
connection management API have been addressed.

NTLM authentication remains the only missing major feature in the new 
codeline that prevents us from moving awards the API freeze.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA3. All upstream 
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported:
-------------------

* NTLM authentication scheme

  Contributed by Johannes Koch <johannes.koch at fit.fraunhofer.de>

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 3
-------------------

ALPHA3 release brings another round of API refinements and improvements in 
functionality. As of this release HttpClient requires Java 5 compatible 
runtime environment and takes full advantage of generics and new concurrency
primitives.     

This release also introduces new default cookie policy that selects a cookie 
specification depending on the format of cookies sent by the target host. 
It is no longer necessary to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support 
the target host provides. HttpClient is now able to pick up either a lenient 
or a strict cookie policy depending on the compliance level of the target host.

Another notable improvement is a completely reworked support for multipart 
entities based on Apache mime4j library.

  major architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API   

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more 
  efficient HTTP transport based on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is 
  expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

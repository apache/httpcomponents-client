Release 4.0 beta 2
-------------------

BETA2 is a maintenance release, which addresses a number of issues 
discovered since the previous release. 

The only significant new feature is an addition of an OSGi compliant 
bundle combining HttpClient and HttpMime jars.

All upstream projects are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

* Fixed NPE in DefaultRequestDirector thrown when retrying a failed 
  request over a proxied connection. 
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-803] Fixed bug in SSL host verifier implementations 
  causing the SSL certificate to be rejected as invalid if the connection 
  is established using an IP address.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-806] DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler will no longer retry
  on ConnectExceptions.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* DigestScheme can use an arbitrary digest algorithm requested by the
  target server (such as SHA) as long as this algorithm is supported by 
  the Java runtime.     
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* Fixed parsing and validation of RFC2109 compliant Set-Cookie headers 
  by the Best-Match cookie spec.     
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* Fixed bug that can cause a managed connection to be returned from the
  pool in an inconsistent state.

4.0 Beta 1
-------------------

BETA1 release brings yet another round of API enhancements and 
improvements in the area of connection management. Among the most notable
ones is the capability to handle stateful connections such as persistent 
NTLM connections and private key authenticated SSL connections.

This is the first API stable release of HttpClient 4.0. All further 
releases in the 4.0 code line will maintain API compatibility with this
release.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA4. All upstream 
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

Please note HttpClient currently provides only limited support for NTLM
authentication. For details please see NTLM_SUPPORT.txt.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 4
-------------------

ALPHA4 marks the completion of the overhaul of the connection management 
code in HttpClient. All known shortcomings of the old HttpClient 3.x 
connection management API have been addressed.

NTLM authentication remains the only missing major feature in the new 
codeline that prevents us from moving awards the API freeze.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA3. All upstream 
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported:
-------------------

* NTLM authentication scheme

  Contributed by Johannes Koch <johannes.koch at fit.fraunhofer.de>

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 3
-------------------

ALPHA3 release brings another round of API refinements and improvements in 
functionality. As of this release HttpClient requires Java 5 compatible 
runtime environment and takes full advantage of generics and new concurrency
primitives.     

This release also introduces new default cookie policy that selects a cookie 
specification depending on the format of cookies sent by the target host. 
It is no longer necessary to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support 
the target host provides. HttpClient is now able to pick up either a lenient 
or a strict cookie policy depending on the compliance level of the target host.

Another notable improvement is a completely reworked support for multipart 
entities based on Apache mime4j library.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.

The HttpClient 4.0 API is still very experimental and is bound to change
during the course of the ALPHA development phase. Several important features
have not yet been ported to the new API.

Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known
  major architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API   

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more 
  efficient HTTP transport based on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is 
  expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

* More modular structure   

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers   

* Support for protocol incerceptors

* Improved connection management 

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of 
  proxies 

* Improved handling redirects of entity enclosing requests

* More flexible SSL context customization 

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of
  generating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP responses 

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported
-------------------
* NTLM authentication scheme

* RFC2965 cookie policy (Cookie2)

* Support for multipart MIME coded entities  

-------------------

Changelog

The following is a list of contributions tracked in JIRA.
